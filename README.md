# Your friendly animal

This miniproject shows you a random message about a random animal and your random chances of making friends with it. 

## What is it built with? 

* Raw JavaScript :)
* Node (just in order to run it locally)

## What can it do? 

Every time you run the script, a function will be called to create a random message with four parts: 
1. an animal
1. an adjective to describe the animal
1. an action (that the animal often does) NOTE: the action will have to be in **third person** (end with an "s")
; and
1. a level of friendship with humans

## Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

[ ] Everytime new, that is, it won't have a pattern of repetition between the parts
